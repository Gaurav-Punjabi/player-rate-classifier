# player-rate-classifier
A small web application using Spring boot and Weka library for java. The single-page application contains a form where the user is asked to input a player's pace, shot, dribble, acceleration and sprint speed.  Taking upon these inputs, the classifier predicts whether the player has a high, medium or low attacking work rate.

### Example
1. Player with "Medium" attacking rate
